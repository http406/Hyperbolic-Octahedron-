# Hyperbolic-Octahedron-

### Hyperbolic Octahedron

A **Hyperbolic Octahedron** is a geometric shape that exists in hyperbolic space, which is a non-Euclidean geometry characterized by a constant negative curvature. Unlike a regular octahedron in Euclidean space, which has flat faces and straight edges, a hyperbolic octahedron has curved faces and edges due to the nature of hyperbolic space.

In the context of the code, the hyperbolic octahedron is represented using parametric equations that define its surface in three-dimensional space. These equations map parameters \( u \) and \( v \) to coordinates \( (x, y, z) \) in 3D space, creating a smooth, curved surface.

### Explanation of the Equations

The parametric equations used in the code to define the hyperbolic octahedron are:

Here’s a breakdown of the components:

1. **Parameters \( u \) and \( v \)**:

2. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - cos(u) and sin(u) are used to create periodic behavior in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions.
   - cos(v) \) and sin(v) are used to create periodic behavior in the \( z \) direction.

3. **Cubing the Results**:
   - The results of the trigonometric functions are raised to the power of 3.
   - This cubing operation introduces curvature and creates the hyperbolic shape. Without the cubing, the equations would define a simpler surface, such as a sphere or ellipsoid.

4. **Mapping to 3D Space**:
   - The equations map the parameters \( u \) and \( v \) to 3D coordinates \( (x, y, z) \).
   - The resulting surface is smooth and curved, with a hyperbolic geometry.

### Why These Equations?

The equations are designed to create a surface with hyperbolic properties. The cubing of the trigonometric functions introduces non-linearities that result in a curved, hyperbolic shape. This shape is visually interesting and has applications in topology, art, and design.

### How the Code Implements the Equations

In the code, the hyperbolic octahedron is generated by sampling points from the parametric equations and creating a mesh. Here’s how it works:

1. **Sampling Points**:
   - The code iterates over a grid of \( u \) and \( v \) values within the specified ranges.
   - For each pair \( (u, v) \), the equations are evaluated to compute the corresponding \( (x, y, z) \) coordinates.

2. **Creating the Mesh**:
   - The computed points are stored in a `BufferGeometry` object.
   - Triangles are created by connecting neighboring points, forming the surface of the hyperbolic octahedron.

3. **Rendering**:
   - The mesh is rendered using Three.js, with colors applied to the vertices to create a gradient effect.

### Footnote

The hyperbolic octahedron is a curved, hyperbolic surface defined by parametric equations. The equations use trigonometric functions and cubing to create the hyperbolic curvature. The code implements these equations by sampling points, creating a mesh, and rendering the shape in 3D space. This approach allows for the visualization of complex hyperbolic geometry in a web-based environment.
